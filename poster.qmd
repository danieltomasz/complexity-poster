- complexity, critialicy and related approaches  looking for system dynamics and variability are  gaining traction in neurosicence
-  Biomarkers based on it are succesful in discrimating states of consciousness,  whiile effort was directed toward styding the content 
- conscious experience is rich and has high dimensional structure [@ji2024SourcesRichnessIneffability], which is set the problem suitable  for next set of tool arising from statistical physics and complexity science

Selected measures of complexity and critility.

Richness of conscious experience pose a question to the neuroscience

# Brain criticality

Criticality is the singular state of complex systems poised at the brink of a phase transition between order and randomness.

Add graph about 1/f aperiodic term 

- add tables with differnt measures explained
- add  soort of SCHEMES
- START FROM WRITING MESSAGES

- autopoiesis as reference??
self organisation of life

graph of different frameworks
- how we could combine it with neurophenomenology?

- flexibility in relation to environment?
- complexity of signal reflects structure of the generators?
- microstates

- complexity of brain signal will reflect inner processes but also envirobmnet
- meditation vs effort

- Information theory 
- dynamical systems

This poster presents a perspective on bridging quantitative measures of neural dynamics with phenomenal consciousness. The connection between self-organizing systems and spectral 1/f phenomena predates the recent surge in studies. Currently, these measures are being used to differentiate states of consciousness (e.g., distinguishing between minimally conscious and vegetative states, identifying sleep phases) and are also applied in research on psychedelics (e.g., the “entropic brain” hypothesis, where stimulants increase the complexity and richness of neuronal communication).

Increased entropy or fractal dimension often correlates with positive affective states (e.g., psychedelics) and cognitive flexibility, whereas reduced complexity is observed in conditions such as depression. These patterns frequently involve NMDA receptors modulation  ( excitation-inhibition framework), providing a mechanistic link to various conditions that alter subjective experience, including schizophrenia and ADHD. Additionally, age-related changes in spectral slope correlate with cognitive reserve capacity, suggesting that variations in brain dynamics may # fundamentally shape phenomenological experience across the lifespan.



# Summary

Despite its promise, there is not yet a coherent framework linking everyday subjective experience with these quantitative measures of neural dynamics. This poster synthesizes primary research directions and highlights potential underlying biological mechanisms while also pointing to the imitations.

# Possible studies ideas

- Ideas put figure about increased number of papers(qualitative experinec + aperiodic + complexity)
