- Complexity and information-theoretic approaches to brain signal were popularized in consciousness research by Integrated Information Theory, but they can be applied without requiring IIT formalism or assumptions @koculak2022HowMuchConsciousness.
- Biomarkers based on these approaches have been successful in discriminating states of consciousness, while much effort has been directed toward studying the content.
-	Conscious experience is rich and has a high-dimensional structure @ji2024SourcesRichnessIneffability, which makes the problem well-suited for the next set of tools arising from dynamical systems, statistical physics and complexity science.

# Quantifying changes in brain signal

- EEG complexity measures can capture intricate neuronal processes that may not be detectable through linear methods
- Many complexity metrics are interrelated; however, entropy exhibits a less straightforward relationship. Further details are provided in   [@donoghue2024EvaluatingComparingMeasures]

# Brain criticality, power laws and 1/f noise


- Decades of evidence point to the synchronization of oscillatory neural signals as one of the key mechanisms underlying information integration and selection.

- “When oscillations are present, they often appear as ‘bumps’ superimposed on the 1/f slope of the power spectrum.” The power spectrum follows a power-law relationship between power and frequency, where power decreases exponentially with increasing frequency. The slope of the 1/f relationship carries important information [@donoghue2020ParameterizingNeuralPower]

- Criticality is the singular state of complex systems poised at the brink of a phase transition between order and randomness,  a special kind of collective behavior observed in many-bodied systems [@obyrne2022HowCriticalBrain].

- The presence of power laws and scale-free distributions in phenomena such as neuronal avalanches is frequently interpreted as evidence of criticality in brain dynamics. Critical brain hypothesis states that global neuronal dynamics of the healthy brain operate at the boundary of a critical phase transition between an ordered and a disordered phase [@obyrne2022HowCriticalBrain]


# Complexity measures for EEG  and brain states

- recently there are several reviews on  topic ([@zimmern2020WhyBrainCriticality], [@sarasso2021ConsciousnessComplexityConsilience])

Currently, these measures are being used to differentiate states of consciousness (e.g., distinguishing between minimally conscious and vegetative states, identifying sleep phases) and are also applied in research on psychedelics (e.g., the “entropic brain” hypothesis, where stimulants increase the complexity and richness of neuronal communication).



Increased entropy or fractal dimension often correlates with positive affective states (e.g., psychedelics) and cognitive flexibility, whereas reduced complexity is observed in conditions such as depression. These patterns frequently involve NMDA receptors modulation  ( excitation-inhibition framework), providing a mechanistic link to various conditions that alter subjective experience, including schizophrenia and ADHD. Additionally, age-related changes in spectral slope correlate with cognitive reserve capacity, suggesting that variations in brain dynamics may # fundamentally shape phenomenological experience across the lifespan.

# Possible mechanisms

# Summary

- This presentation doesn want to be exaustive  iterarture review, rather want to discuss plausisibility of linking this  dynamics altering experience - ADHD, autism, schisophrenia, time perception

- There are many ways to measure the complexity and variability of brain signals, which are often closely related.
- The relationship is not linear, more complexity or dynamics isn'r always better; intermediate states between chaos and excessive order enable the brain to respond flexibly and adaptively to environmental demands. 

- The most plausible underlying mechanism is the balance between excitation and inhibition
- Surrogate data testing is essential for distinguishing genuine criticality from spurious findings

- Although power-law behavior is a hallmark of criticality, it can also emerge from non-critical processes, making it an insufficient criterion on its own
