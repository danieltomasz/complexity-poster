  abstract = {A typical claim in anti-representationalist approaches to cognition such as ecological psychology or radical embodied cognitive science is that ecological information is sufficient for guiding behavior. According to this view, affordances are immediately perceptually available to the agent (in the so-called ``ambient energy array''), so sensory data does not require much further inner processing. As a consequence, mental representations are explanatorily idle: perception is immediate and direct. Here we offer one way to formalize this direct-perception claim and identify some important limits to it. We argue that the claim should be read as saying that successful behavior just implies picking out affordance-related information from the ambient energy array. By relying on the Partial Information Decomposition framework, and more concretely on its development of the notion of synergy, we show that in multimodal perception, where various energy arrays carry affordance-related information, the ``just pick out affordance-related information'' approach is very inefficient, as it is bound to miss all synergistic components. Efficient multimodal information combination requires transmitting sensory-specific (and not affordance-specific) information to wherever it is that the various information streams are combined. The upshot is that some amount of computation is necessary for efficient affordance reconstruction.},

  abstract = {Recent evidence in cognitive neuroscience indicates that the visual system is influenced by the outcome of an early appraisal mechanism that automatically evaluates what is seen as being harmful or beneficial for the organism. This indicates that there could be valence in perception. But what could it mean for one to see something positively or negatively? Although most theories of emotions accept that valence involves being related to values, the nature of this relation remains highly debated. Some explain valence in terms of evaluative content, others in terms of evaluative attitude. Here I shall argue that an account of affective perception in terms of attitude has more chance to succeed. To do so, I will first highlight the difficulties that a content-based approach faces, considering the many forms it might take. I will conclude that seeing the world positively or negatively involves more than a positive or negative content; it involves a distinctive attitude, but which one? Should it be conceived in imperative or evaluative terms? And what makes this attitude distinct from a proper emotion?},

  abstract = {Band ratio measures, computed as the ratio of power between two frequency bands, are a common analysis measure in neuroelectrophysiological recordings. Band ratio measures are typically interpreted as reflecting quantitative measures of periodic, or oscillatory, activity. This assumes that the measure reflects relative powers of distinct periodic components that are well captured by predefined frequency ranges. However, electrophysiological signals contain periodic components and a 1/f-like aperiodic component, the latter of which contributes power across all frequencies. Here, we investigate whether band ratio measures truly reflect oscillatory power differences, and/or to what extent ratios may instead reflect other periodic changes, such as in center frequency or bandwidth, and/or aperiodic activity. In simulation, we investigate how band ratio measures relate to changes in multiple spectral features, and show how multiple periodic and aperiodic features influence band ratio measures. We validate these findings in human electroencephalography (EEG) data, comparing band ratio measures to parameterizations of power spectral features and find that multiple disparate features influence ratio measures. For example, the commonly applied {\texttheta}/{$\beta$} ratio is most reflective of differences in aperiodic activity, and not oscillatory {\texttheta} or {$\beta$} power. Collectively, we show that periodic and aperiodic features can create the same observed changes in band ratio measures, and that this is inconsistent with their typical interpretations as measures of periodic power. We conclude that band ratio measures are a non-specific measure, conflating multiple possible underlying spectral changes, and recommend explicit parameterization of neural power spectra as a more specific approach.},

  abstract = {Neuro-electrophysiological recordings contain prominent aperiodic activity - meaning irregular activity, with no characteristic frequency - which has variously been referred to as 1/f (or 1/f-like activity), fractal, or 'scale-free' activity. Previous work has established that aperiodic features of neural activity is dynamic and variable, relating (between subjects) to healthy aging and to clinical diagnoses, and also (within subjects) tracking conscious states and behavioral performance. There are, however, a wide variety of conceptual frameworks and associated methods for the analyses and interpretation of aperiodic activity - for example, time domain measures such as the autocorrelation, fractal measures, and/or various complexity and entropy measures, as well as measures of the aperiodic exponent in the frequency domain. There is a lack of clear understanding of how these different measures relate to each other and to what extent they reflect the same or different properties of the data, which makes it difficult to synthesize results across approaches and complicates our overall understanding of the properties, biological significance, and demographic, clinical, and behavioral correlates of aperiodic neural activity. To address this problem, in this project we systematically survey the different approaches for measuring aperiodic neural activity, starting with an automated literature analysis to curate a collection of the most common methods. We then evaluate and compare these methods, using statistically representative time series simulations. In doing so, we establish consistent relationships between the measures, showing that much of what they capture reflects shared variance - though with some notable idiosyncrasies. Broadly, frequency domain methods are more specific to aperiodic features of the data, whereas time domain measures are more impacted by oscillatory activity. We extend this analysis by applying the measures to a series of empirical EEG and iEEG datasets, replicating the simulation results. We conclude by summarizing the relationships between the multiple methods, emphasizing opportunities for re-examining previous findings and for future work.},

  abstract = {The study of aperiodic neural activity -- reflecting patterns of non-frequency specific activity that are observed in electrical neural recordings such as M/EEG and intracranial LFP recordings -- has recently rapidly expanded as a topic of study. While the extent of this work reflects a newfound interest in the study of aperiodic activity, the study of aperiodic activity itself is not new. There is a rich, though arguably underappreciated, history of work developing and demonstrating key findings and ideas regarding aperiodic neural activity, dating back many decades. In addition, studies of behavior, physiology, and physics have contributed many ideas, methods, and theoretical frameworks that have informed the study of neural activity. This perspective explores the history of the study of aperiodic neural activity and related topics, covering early discussions of separating oscillatory and aperiodic activity that started in the late 1940s, the emergence of frequency-domain measures of non-frequency specific activity by the mid 1970s, and findings from across the subsequent half-century of work investigating how aperiodic neural activity relates to development, cognition, disease, and more. Collectively, this history set the foundation for key ideas regarding aperiodic activity prior to the recent (re-)emergence of these topics in contemporary work. In summarizing this historical study of aperiodic neural activity, this perspective seeks both to establish the historical context of such work as well as to emphasize the wealth of knowledge available in the historical record to contextualize and contribute to current and future work.},

  abstract = {In the study of neuro-electrophysiological recordings, aperiodic neural activity -- activity with no characteristic frequency -- has increasingly become a common feature of study. This interest has rapidly extended to clinical work, with many reports investigating aperiodic activity from patients from a broad range of clinical disorders. This work typically seeks to evaluate aperiodic activity as a putative biomarker relating to diagnosis or treatment response, and/or as a potential marker of underlying physiological activity. There is thus far no clear consensus on if and how aperiodic neural activity relates to clinical disorders, nor on the best practices for how to study it in clinical research. To address this, this systematic literature review, following PRISMA guidelines, examines reports of aperiodic activity in electrophysiological recordings with human patients with psychiatric and/or neurological disorders, finding 143 reports across 35 distinct disorders. Reports within and across disorders are summarized to evaluate current findings and examine what can be learned as pertains to the analysis, interpretations, and overall utility of aperiodic neural activity in clinical investigations. Aperiodic activity is commonly reported to relate to clinical diagnoses, with 31 of 35 disorders reporting a significant effect in diagnostic and/or treatment related studies. However, there is variation in the consistency of results across disorders, with the heterogeneity of patient groups, disease etiologies, and treatment status arising as common themes across different disorders. Overall, the current variability of results, potentially confounding covariates, and limitations in current understanding of aperiodic activity suggests further work is needed before aperiodic activity can be established as a potential biomarker and/or marker of underlying pathological physiology. Finally, a series of recommendations are proposed, based on the findings, limitations, and key discussion topics of the current literature to assist with guiding productive future work on the clinical utility of studying aperiodic neural activity.

  abstract = {Conscious states---state that there is something it is like to be in---seem both rich or full of detail and ineffable or hard to fully describe or recall. The problem of ineffability, in particular, is a longstanding issue in philosophy that partly motivates the explanatory gap: the belief that consciousness cannot be reduced to underlying physical processes. Here, we provide an information theoretic dynamical systems perspective on the richness and ineffability of consciousness. In our framework, the richness of conscious experience corresponds to the amount of information in a conscious state and ineffability corresponds to the amount of information lost at different stages of processing. We describe how attractor dynamics in working memory would induce impoverished recollections of our original experiences, how the discrete symbolic nature of language is insufficient for describing the rich and high-dimensional structure of experiences, and how similarity in the cognitive function of two individuals relates to improved communicability of their experiences to each other. While our model may not settle all questions relating to the explanatory gap, it makes progress toward a fully physicalist explanation of the richness and ineffability of conscious experience---two important aspects that seem to be part of what makes qualitative character so puzzling.},

  abstract = {Consciousness has been proposed to be supported by electrophysiological patterns poised at criticality, a dynamical regime which exhibits adaptive computational properties, maximally complex patterns and divergent sensitivity to perturbation. Here, we investigate dynamical properties of the resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) of healthy subjects undergoing general anesthesia with propofol, xenon or ketamine. Importantly, all participants were unresponsive under anesthesia, while consciousness was retained only during ketamine anesthesia (in the form of vivid dreams), enabling an experimental dissociation between unresponsiveness and unconsciousness. For each condition, we measure (i) avalanche criticality, (ii) chaoticity, and (iii) criticality-related metrics, revealing that states of unconsciousness are characterized by a distancing from both avalanche criticality and the edge of chaos. We then ask whether these same dynamical properties are predictive of the perturbational complexity index (PCI), a TMS-based measure that has shown remarkably high sensitivity in detecting consciousness independently of behavior. We successfully predict individual subjects' PCI values with considerably high accuracy from resting-state EEG dynamical properties alone. Our results establish a firm link between perturbational complexity and criticality, and provide further evidence that criticality is a necessary condition for the emergence of consciousness.},

Brain states differ on their balance between excitation and inhibition, and on the diversity of their activity patterns.

Here we analyzed the relation between 1/f slope and LZc with two in-silico approaches and in both rat EEG and monkey ECoG data. We contrasted resting state with propofol anesthesia, which directly modulates the excitation-inhibition balance. We found convergent results among simulated and empirical data, showing a strong, inverse and non trivial monotonic relation between 1/f slope and complexity, consistent at both ECoG and EEG scales. We hypothesize that differentially entropic regimes could underlie the link between the excitation-inhibition balance and the vastness of the repertoire of brain systems.},

  abstract = {Given their recent success in counseling and psychiatry, the dialogue around psychedelics has mainly focused on their applications for mental health. Insights from psychedelic research, however, are not limited to treating mental health, but also have much to offer our current understanding of consciousness. The investigation of psychedelic states has offered new perspectives on how different aspects of conscious experience are mediated by brain activity; as such, much more has been learned about consciousness in terms of its phenomenology and potential mechanisms. One theory that describes how psychedelics influence brain activity is the ``entropic brain theory'' (EBT), which attempts to understand conscious states---normal and psychedelic---in terms of ``brain entropy.'' Given its wide explanatory reach, this theory has several implications for current debates in consciousness research, namely the issue of whether consciousness exists in levels vs. dimensions; whether the psychedelic state is itself a ``higher'' level of consciousness; and if so, whether psychedelics could be used to treat disorders of consciousness. To understand how psychedelics could possibly treat a minimally conscious or vegetative patient, one must first understand EBT and how this theory intersects with these ongoing debates. Thus, this article offers a formal summary of EBT, distilling its core principles and their implications for a theoretical model of consciousness. In response to their proposed use in treating disorders of consciousness, we emphasize the importance of ``set'' and ``setting'' in ascertaining the therapeutic value of psychedelics for vegetative and/or minimally conscious patients.},

  abstract = {Over the last years, a surge of empirical studies converged on complexity-related measures as reliable markers of consciousness across many different conditions, such as sleep, anesthesia, hallucinatory states, coma, and related disorders. Most of these measures were independently proposed by researchers endorsing disparate frameworks and employing different methods and techniques. Since this body of evidence has not been systematically reviewed and coherently organized so far, this positive trend has remained somewhat below the radar. The aim of this paper is to make this consilience of evidence in the science of consciousness explicit. We start with a systematic assessment of the growing literature on complexity-related measures and identify their common denominator, tracing it back to core theoretical principles and predictions put forward more than 20 years ago. In doing this, we highlight a consistent trajectory spanning two decades of consciousness research and provide a provisional taxonomy of the present literature. Finally, we consider all of the above as a positive ground to approach new questions and devise future experiments that may help consolidate and further develop a promising field where empirical research on consciousness appears to have, so far, naturally converged.},

  abstract = {The past 25 years have seen a strong increase in the number of publications related to criticality in different areas of neuroscience. The potential of criticality to explain various brain properties, including optimal information processing, has made it an increasingly exciting area of investigation for neuroscientists. Recent reviews on this topic, sometimes termed brain criticality, make brief mention of clinical applications of these findings to several neurological disorders such as epilepsy, neurodegenerative disease, and neonatal hypoxia. Other clinicallyrelevant domains -- including anesthesia, sleep medicine, developmental-behavioral pediatrics, and psychiatry -- are seldom discussed in review papers of brain criticality. Thorough assessments of these application areas and their relevance for clinicians have also yet to be published. In this scoping review, studies of brain criticality involving human data of all ages are evaluated for their current and future clinical relevance. To make the results of these studies understandable to a more clinical audience, a review of the key concepts behind criticality (e.g., phase transitions, long-range temporal correlation, self-organized criticality, power laws, branching processes) precedes the discussion of human clinical studies. Open questions and forthcoming areas of investigation are also considered.},
