  abstract = {The study of aperiodic neural activity -- reflecting patterns of non-frequency specific activity that are observed in electrical neural recordings such as M/EEG and intracranial LFP recordings -- has recently rapidly expanded as a topic of study. While the extent of this work reflects a newfound interest in the study of aperiodic activity, the study of aperiodic activity itself is not new. There is a rich, though arguably underappreciated, history of work developing and demonstrating key findings and ideas regarding aperiodic neural activity, dating back many decades. In addition, studies of behavior, physiology, and physics have contributed many ideas, methods, and theoretical frameworks that have informed the study of neural activity. This perspective explores the history of the study of aperiodic neural activity and related topics, covering early discussions of separating oscillatory and aperiodic activity that started in the late 1940s, the emergence of frequency-domain measures of non-frequency specific activity by the mid 1970s, and findings from across the subsequent half-century of work investigating how aperiodic neural activity relates to development, cognition, disease, and more. Collectively, this history set the foundation for key ideas regarding aperiodic activity prior to the recent (re-)emergence of these topics in contemporary work. In summarizing this historical study of aperiodic neural activity, this perspective seeks both to establish the historical context of such work as well as to emphasize the wealth of knowledge available in the historical record to contextualize and contribute to current and future work.},

  abstract = {In the study of neuro-electrophysiological recordings, aperiodic neural activity -- activity with no characteristic frequency -- has increasingly become a common feature of study. This interest has rapidly extended to clinical work, with many reports investigating aperiodic activity from patients from a broad range of clinical disorders. This work typically seeks to evaluate aperiodic activity as a putative biomarker relating to diagnosis or treatment response, and/or as a potential marker of underlying physiological activity. There is thus far no clear consensus on if and how aperiodic neural activity relates to clinical disorders, nor on the best practices for how to study it in clinical research. To address this, this systematic literature review, following PRISMA guidelines, examines reports of aperiodic activity in electrophysiological recordings with human patients with psychiatric and/or neurological disorders, finding 143 reports across 35 distinct disorders. Reports within and across disorders are summarized to evaluate current findings and examine what can be learned as pertains to the analysis, interpretations, and overall utility of aperiodic neural activity in clinical investigations. Aperiodic activity is commonly reported to relate to clinical diagnoses, with 31 of 35 disorders reporting a significant effect in diagnostic and/or treatment related studies. However, there is variation in the consistency of results across disorders, with the heterogeneity of patient groups, disease etiologies, and treatment status arising as common themes across different disorders. Overall, the current variability of results, potentially confounding covariates, and limitations in current understanding of aperiodic activity suggests further work is needed before aperiodic activity can be established as a potential biomarker and/or marker of underlying pathological physiology. Finally, a series of recommendations are proposed, based on the findings, limitations, and key discussion topics of the current literature to assist with guiding productive future work on the clinical utility of studying aperiodic neural activity.

  abstract = {Conscious states---state that there is something it is like to be in---seem both rich or full of detail and ineffable or hard to fully describe or recall. The problem of ineffability, in particular, is a longstanding issue in philosophy that partly motivates the explanatory gap: the belief that consciousness cannot be reduced to underlying physical processes. Here, we provide an information theoretic dynamical systems perspective on the richness and ineffability of consciousness. In our framework, the richness of conscious experience corresponds to the amount of information in a conscious state and ineffability corresponds to the amount of information lost at different stages of processing. We describe how attractor dynamics in working memory would induce impoverished recollections of our original experiences, how the discrete symbolic nature of language is insufficient for describing the rich and high-dimensional structure of experiences, and how similarity in the cognitive function of two individuals relates to improved communicability of their experiences to each other. While our model may not settle all questions relating to the explanatory gap, it makes progress toward a fully physicalist explanation of the richness and ineffability of conscious experience---two important aspects that seem to be part of what makes qualitative character so puzzling.},

  abstract = {Consciousness has been proposed to be supported by electrophysiological patterns poised at criticality, a dynamical regime which exhibits adaptive computational properties, maximally complex patterns and divergent sensitivity to perturbation. Here, we investigate dynamical properties of the resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) of healthy subjects undergoing general anesthesia with propofol, xenon or ketamine. Importantly, all participants were unresponsive under anesthesia, while consciousness was retained only during ketamine anesthesia (in the form of vivid dreams), enabling an experimental dissociation between unresponsiveness and unconsciousness. For each condition, we measure (i) avalanche criticality, (ii) chaoticity, and (iii) criticality-related metrics, revealing that states of unconsciousness are characterized by a distancing from both avalanche criticality and the edge of chaos. We then ask whether these same dynamical properties are predictive of the perturbational complexity index (PCI), a TMS-based measure that has shown remarkably high sensitivity in detecting consciousness independently of behavior. We successfully predict individual subjects' PCI values with considerably high accuracy from resting-state EEG dynamical properties alone. Our results establish a firm link between perturbational complexity and criticality, and provide further evidence that criticality is a necessary condition for the emergence of consciousness.},

Brain states differ on their balance between excitation and inhibition, and on the diversity of their activity patterns. These can be respectively indexed by 1/f slope and Lempel--Ziv complexity (LZc). However, whether and how these two brain state properties relate remain elusive. Here we analyzed the relation between 1/f slope and LZc with two in-silico approaches and in both rat EEG and monkey ECoG data. We contrasted resting state with propofol anesthesia, which directly modulates the excitation-inhibition balance. We found convergent results among simulated and empirical data, showing a strong, inverse and non trivial monotonic relation between 1/f slope and complexity, consistent at both ECoG and EEG scales. We hypothesize that differentially entropic regimes could underlie the link between the excitation-inhibition balance and the vastness of the repertoire of brain systems.},

Serotonergic psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin produce states of increased sensory-emotional awareness and arousal, accompanied by increased spontaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) signal diversity. By directly stimulating cortical tissue, the altered dynamics and propagation of the evoked EEG activity can reveal drug-induced changes in the overall brain state. We combine Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and EEG to reveal that psilocybin produces a state of increased chaotic brain activity which is not a result of altered complexity in the underlying causal interactions between brain regions.

  abstract = {Given their recent success in counseling and psychiatry, the dialogue around psychedelics has mainly focused on their applications for mental health. Insights from psychedelic research, however, are not limited to treating mental health, but also have much to offer our current understanding of consciousness. The investigation of psychedelic states has offered new perspectives on how different aspects of conscious experience are mediated by brain activity; as such, much more has been learned about consciousness in terms of its phenomenology and potential mechanisms. One theory that describes how psychedelics influence brain activity is the ``entropic brain theory'' (EBT), which attempts to understand conscious states---normal and psychedelic---in terms of ``brain entropy.'' Given its wide explanatory reach, this theory has several implications for current debates in consciousness research, namely the issue of whether consciousness exists in levels vs. dimensions; whether the psychedelic state is itself a ``higher'' level of consciousness; and if so, whether psychedelics could be used to treat disorders of consciousness. To understand how psychedelics could possibly treat a minimally conscious or vegetative patient, one must first understand EBT and how this theory intersects with these ongoing debates. Thus, this article offers a formal summary of EBT, distilling its core principles and their implications for a theoretical model of consciousness. In response to their proposed use in treating disorders of consciousness, we emphasize the importance of ``set'' and ``setting'' in ascertaining the therapeutic value of psychedelics for vegetative and/or minimally conscious patients.},

Most of these measures were independently proposed by researchers endorsing disparate frameworks and employing different methods and techniques. Since this body of evidence has not been systematically reviewed and coherently organized so far, this positive trend has remained somewhat below the radar. The aim of this paper is to make this consilience of evidence in the science of consciousness explicit. We start with a systematic assessment of the growing literature on complexity-related measures and identify their common denominator, tracing it back to core theoretical principles and predictions put forward more than 20 years ago. In doing this, we highlight a consistent trajectory spanning two decades of consciousness research and provide a provisional taxonomy of the present literature. Finally, we consider all of the above as a positive ground to approach new questions and devise future experiments that may help consolidate and further develop a promising field where empirical research on consciousness appears to have, so far, naturally converged.},

  abstract = {The past 25 years have seen a strong increase in the number of publications related to criticality in different areas of neuroscience. The potential of criticality to explain various brain properties, including optimal information processing, has made it an increasingly exciting area of investigation for neuroscientists. Recent reviews on this topic, sometimes termed brain criticality, make brief mention of clinical applications of these findings to several neurological disorders such as epilepsy, neurodegenerative disease, and neonatal hypoxia. Other clinicallyrelevant domains -- including anesthesia, sleep medicine, developmental-behavioral pediatrics, and psychiatry -- are seldom discussed in review papers of brain criticality. Thorough assessments of these application areas and their relevance for clinicians have also yet to be published. In this scoping review, studies of brain criticality involving human data of all ages are evaluated for their current and future clinical relevance. To make the results of these studies understandable to a more clinical audience, a review of the key concepts behind criticality (e.g., phase transitions, long-range temporal correlation, self-organized criticality, power laws, branching processes) precedes the discussion of human clinical studies. Open questions and forthcoming areas of investigation are also considered.},
